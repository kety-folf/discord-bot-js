                            pweambwe

  the gnu genewaw puwbwic license is a fwee, copyweft wicense fow
softwawe and othew kinds of wowks.
 
  the wicenses fow most softwawe and othew pwacticaw wowks awe designed
to take away uw fweedom to shawe and change the wowks. By contwast,
the gnu genewaw puwbwic license is intended to guwawantee uw fweedom to
shawe and change aww vewsions of a pwogwam--to make suwwe it wemains fwee
softwawe fow aww its uwsews. We, the fwee softwawe fouwndation, uwse the
gnu genewaw puwbwic license fow most of ouww softwawe; it appwies awso to
any othew wowk weweased this way by its auwthows. Youw can appwy it to
uw pwogwams, too.
 
  when we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom, not
pwice. Ouww genewaw puwbwic licenses awe designed to make suwwe that u
have the fweedom to distwibuwte copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge fow
them if u wish), that u weceive souwwce code ow can get it if u
want it, that u can change the softwawe ow uwse pieces of it in new
fwee pwogwams, and that u know u can do these things.
 
  to pwotect uw wights, we need to pwevent othews fwom denying u
these wights ow asking u to suwwwendew the wights. Thewefowe, u have
cewtain wesponsibiwities if u distwibuwte copies of the softwawe, ow if
u modify it: wesponsibiwities to wespect the fweedom of othews.
 
  fow exampwe, if u distwibuwte copies of suwch a pwogwam, whethew
gwatis ow fow a fee, u muwst pass on to the wecipients the same
fweedoms that u weceived. Youw muwst make suwwe that they, too, weceive
ow can get the souwwce code. And u muwst show them these tewms so they
know theiw wights.
 
  devewopews that uwse the gnu gpl pwotect uw wights with two steps:
(1) assewt copywight on the softwawe, and (2) offew u this license
giving u wegaw pewmission to copy, distwibuwte and/ow modify it.
 
  fow the devewopews' and auwthows' pwotection, the gpl cweawwy expwains
that thewe is no wawwanty fow this fwee softwawe. Fow both uwsews' and
auwthows' sake, the gpl wequwiwes that modified vewsions be mawked as
changed, so that theiw pwobwems wiww not be attwibuwted ewwoneouwswy to
auwthows of pweviouws vewsions.
 
  some devices awe designed to deny uwsews access to instaww ow wuwn
modified vewsions of the softwawe inside them, awthouwgh the manuwfactuwwew
can do so. This is fuwndamentawwy incompatibwe with the aim of
pwotecting uwsews' fweedom to change the softwawe. The systematic
pattewn of suwch abuwse occuwws in the awea of pwoduwcts fow individuwaws to
uwse, which is pwecisewy whewe it is most uwnacceptabwe. Thewefowe, we
have designed this vewsion of the gpl to pwohibit the pwactice fow those
pwoduwcts. If suwch pwobwems awise suwbstantiawwy in othew domains, we
stand weady to extend this pwovision to those domains in fuwtuwwe vewsions
of the gpl, as needed to pwotect the fweedom of uwsews.
 
  finawwy, evewy pwogwam is thweatened constantwy by softwawe patents.
 states shouwwd not awwow patents to westwict devewopment and uwse of
softwawe on genewaw-puwwpose compuwtews, buwt in those that do, we wish to
avoid the speciaw dangew that patents appwied to a fwee pwogwam couwwd
make it effectivewy pwopwietawy. To pwevent this, the gpl assuwwes that
patents cannot be uwsed to wendew the pwogwam non-fwee.

modification fowwow.
 
                       terms and conditions

  0. Definitions.
 
  "this license" wefews to vewsion 3 of the gnu genewaw puwbwic license.
 
  "copywight" awso means copywight-wike waws that appwy to othew kinds of
wowks, suwch as semiconduwctow masks.
 
  "the pwogwam" wefews to any copywightabwe wowk wicensed uwndew this
license. Each wicensee is addwessed as "u". "licensees" and
"wecipients" may be individuwaws ow owganizations.
 
  to "modify" a wowk means to copy fwom ow adapt aww ow pawt of the wowk
in a fashion wequwiwing copywight pewmission, othew than the making of an
exact copy. The wesuwwting wowk is cawwed a "modified vewsion" of the
eawwiew wowk ow a wowk "based on" the eawwiew wowk.
 
  a "covewed wowk" means eithew the uwnmodified pwogwam ow a wowk based
on the pwogwam.
 
  to "pwopagate" a wowk means to do anything with it that, withouwt
pewmission, wouwwd make u diwectwy ow secondawiwy wiabwe fow
infwingement uwndew appwicabwe copywight waw, except execuwting it on a
compuwtew ow modifying a pwivate copy. Pwopagation incwuwdes copying,
distwibuwtion (with ow withouwt modification), making avaiwabwe to the
puwbwic, and in some couwntwies othew activities as weww.
 
  to "convey" a wowk means any kind of pwopagation that enabwes othew
pawties to make ow weceive copies. Mewe intewaction with a uwsew thwouwgh
a compuwtew netwowk, with no twansfew of a copy, is not conveying.
 
  an intewactive uwsew intewface dispways "appwopwiate legaw notices"
to the extent that it incwuwdes a convenient and pwominentwy visibwe
featuwwe that (1) dispways an appwopwiate copywight notice, and (2)
tewws the uwsew that thewe is no wawwanty fow the wowk (except to the
extent that wawwanties awe pwovided), that wicensees may convey the
wowk uwndew this license, and how to view a copy of this license. If
the intewface pwesents a wist of uwsew commands ow options, suwch as a
menuw, a pwominent item in the wist meets this cwitewion.
 
  1. Souwwce code.
 
  the "souwwce code" fow a wowk means the pwefewwed fowm of the wowk
fow making modifications to it. "object code" means any non-souwwce
fowm of a wowk.
 
  a "standawd intewface" means an intewface that eithew is an officiaw
standawd defined by a wecognized standawds body, ow, in the case of
intewfaces specified fow a pawticuwwaw pwogwamming wanguwage, one that
is widewy uwsed among devewopews wowking in that wanguwage.
 
  the "system libwawies" of an execuwtabwe wowk incwuwde anything, othew
than the wowk as a whowe, that (a) is incwuwded in the nowmaw fowm of
packaging a majow component, buwt which is not pawt of that majow
component, and (b) sewves onwy to enabwe uwse of the wowk with that
majow component, ow to impwement a standawd intewface fow which an
impwementation is avaiwabwe to the puwbwic in souwwce code fowm. A
"majow component", in this context, means a majow essentiaw component
(kewnew, window system, and so on) of the specific opewating system
(if any) on which the execuwtabwe wowk wuwns, ow a compiwew uwsed to
pwoduwce the wowk, ow an object code intewpwetew uwsed to wuwn it.
 
  the "cowwesponding souwwce" fow a wowk in object code fowm means aww
the souwwce code needed to genewate, instaww, and (fow an execuwtabwe
wowk) wuwn the object code and to modify the wowk, incwuwding scwipts to
contwow those activities. Howevew, it does not incwuwde the wowk's
system libwawies, ow genewaw-puwwpose toows ow genewawwy avaiwabwe fwee
pwogwams which awe uwsed uwnmodified in pewfowming those activities buwt
which awe not pawt of the wowk. Fow exampwe, cowwesponding souwwce
incwuwdes intewface definition fiwes associated with souwwce fiwes fow
the wowk, and the souwwce code fow shawed wibwawies and dynamicawwy
winked suwbpwogwams that the wowk is specificawwy designed to wequwiwe,
suwch as by intimate data commuwnication ow contwow fwow between those
suwbpwogwams and othew pawts of the wowk.
 
  the cowwesponding souwwce need not incwuwde anything that uwsews
can wegenewate auwtomaticawwy fwom othew pawts of the cowwesponding
souwwce.
 
  the cowwesponding souwwce fow a wowk in souwwce code fowm is that
same wowk.
 
  2. Basic pewmissions.
 
  aww wights gwanted uwndew this license awe gwanted fow the tewm of
copywight on the pwogwam, and awe iwwevocabwe pwovided the stated
conditions awe met. This license expwicitwy affiwms uw uwnwimited
pewmission to wuwn the uwnmodified pwogwam. The ouwtpuwt fwom wuwnning a
covewed wowk is covewed by this license onwy if the ouwtpuwt, given its
content, constituwtes a covewed wowk. This license acknowwedges uw
wights of faiw uwse ow othew equwivawent, as pwovided by copywight waw.
 
  youw may make, wuwn and pwopagate covewed wowks that u do not
convey, withouwt conditions so wong as uw wicense othewwise wemains
in fowce. Youw may convey covewed wowks to othews fow the sowe puwwpose
of having them make modifications excwuwsivewy fow u, ow pwovide u
with faciwities fow wuwnning those wowks, pwovided that u compwy with
the tewms of this license in conveying aww matewiaw fow which u do
not contwow copywight. Those thuws making ow wuwnning the covewed wowks
fow u muwst do so excwuwsivewy on uw behawf, uwndew uw diwection
and contwow, on tewms that pwohibit them fwom making any copies of
uw copywighted matewiaw ouwtside theiw wewationship with u.
 
  conveying uwndew any othew ciwcuwmstances is pewmitted sowewy uwndew
the conditions stated bewow. Suwbwicensing is not awwowed; section 10
makes it uwnnecessawy.
 
  3. Pwotecting usews' legaw rights fwom anti-ciwcuwmvention law.
 
  no covewed wowk shaww be deemed pawt of an effective technowogicaw
measuwwe uwndew any appwicabwe waw fuwwfiwwing obwigations uwndew awticwe
11 of the wipo copywight tweaty adopted on 20 decembew 1996, ow
simiwaw waws pwohibiting ow westwicting ciwcuwmvention of suwch
measuwwes.
 
  when u convey a covewed wowk, u waive any wegaw powew to fowbid
ciwcuwmvention of technowogicaw measuwwes to the extent suwch ciwcuwmvention
is effected by exewcising wights uwndew this license with wespect to
the covewed wowk, and u discwaim any intention to wimit opewation ow
modification of the wowk as a means of enfowcing, against the wowk's
uwsews, uw ow thiwd pawties' wegaw wights to fowbid ciwcuwmvention of
technowogicaw measuwwes.
 
  4. Conveying vewbatim copies.
 
  youw may convey vewbatim copies of the pwogwam's souwwce code as u
weceive it, in any mediuwm, pwovided that u conspicuwouwswy and
appwopwiatewy puwbwish on each copy an appwopwiate copywight notice;
keep intact aww notices stating that this license and any
non-pewmissive tewms added in accowd with section 7 appwy to the code;
keep intact aww notices of the absence of any wawwanty; and give aww
wecipients a copy of this license awong with the pwogwam.
 
  youw may chawge any pwice ow no pwice fow each copy that u convey,
and u may offew suwppowt ow wawwanty pwotection fow a fee.
 
  5. Conveying modified souwwce vewsions.
 
  youw may convey a wowk based on the pwogwam, ow the modifications to
pwoduwce it fwom the pwogwam, in the fowm of souwwce code uwndew the
tewms of section 4, pwovided that u awso meet aww of these conditions:

    a) the wowk muwst cawwy pwominent notices stating that u modified
    it, and giving a wewevant date.
 
    b) the wowk muwst cawwy pwominent notices stating that it is
    weweased uwndew this license and any conditions added uwndew section
    7. This wequwiwement modifies the wequwiwement in section 4 to
    "keep intact aww notices".
 
    c) youw muwst wicense the entiwe wowk, as a whowe, uwndew this
    license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
    license wiww thewefowe appwy, awong with any appwicabwe section 7
    additionaw tewms, to the whowe of the wowk, and aww its pawts,
    wegawdwess of how they awe packaged. This license gives no
    pewmission to wicense the wowk in any othew way, buwt it does not
    invawidate suwch pewmission if u have sepawatewy weceived it.
 
    d) if the wowk has intewactive uwsew intewfaces, each muwst dispway
    appwopwiate legaw notices; howevew, if the pwogwam has intewactive
    intewfaces that do not dispway appwopwiate legaw notices, uw
    wowk need not make them do so.
 
  a compiwation of a covewed wowk with othew sepawate and independent
wowks, which awe not by theiw natuwwe extensions of the covewed wowk,
and which awe not combined with it suwch as to fowm a wawgew pwogwam,
in ow on a vowuwme of a stowage ow distwibuwtion mediuwm, is cawwed an
"aggwegate" if the compiwation and its wesuwwting copywight awe not
uwsed to wimit the access ow wegaw wights of the compiwation's uwsews
beyond what the individuwaw wowks pewmit. Incwuwsion of a covewed wowk
in an aggwegate does not cauwse this license to appwy to the othew
pawts of the aggwegate.
 
  6. Conveying non-souwwce fowms.
 
  youw may convey a covewed wowk in object code fowm uwndew the tewms
of sections 4 and 5, pwovided that u awso convey the
machine-weadabwe cowwesponding souwwce uwndew the tewms of this license,
in one of these ways:

    a) convey the object code in, ow embodied in, a physicaw pwoduwct
    (incwuwding a physicaw distwibuwtion mediuwm), accompanied by the
    cowwesponding souwwce fixed on a duwwabwe physicaw mediuwm
    cuwstomawiwy uwsed fow softwawe intewchange.
 
    b) convey the object code in, ow embodied in, a physicaw pwoduwct
    (incwuwding a physicaw distwibuwtion mediuwm), accompanied by a
    wwitten offew, vawid fow at weast thwee yeaws and vawid fow as
    wong as u offew spawe pawts ow cuwstomew suwppowt fow that pwoduwct
    modew, to give anyone who possesses the object code eithew (1) a
    copy of the cowwesponding souwwce fow aww the softwawe in the
    pwoduwct that is covewed by this license, on a duwwabwe physicaw
    mediuwm cuwstomawiwy uwsed fow softwawe intewchange, fow a pwice no
    mowe than uw weasonabwe cost of physicawwy pewfowming this
    conveying of souwwce, ow (2) access to copy the
    cowwesponding souwwce fwom a netwowk sewvew at no chawge.
 
    c) convey individuwaw copies of the object code with a copy of the
    wwitten offew to pwovide the cowwesponding souwwce. This
    awtewnative is awwowed onwy occasionawwy and noncommewciawwy, and
    onwy if u weceived the object code with suwch an offew, in accowd
    with suwbsection 6b.
 
    d) convey the object code by offewing access fwom a designated
    pwace (gwatis ow fow a chawge), and offew equwivawent access to the
    cowwesponding souwwce in the same way thwouwgh the same pwace at no
    fuwwthew chawge. Youw need not wequwiwe wecipients to copy the
    cowwesponding souwwce awong with the object code. If the pwace to
    copy the object code is a netwowk sewvew, the cowwesponding souwwce
    may be on a diffewent sewvew (opewated by u ow a thiwd pawty)
    that suwppowts equwivawent copying faciwities, pwovided u maintain
    cweaw diwections next to the object code saying whewe to find the
    cowwesponding souwwce. Regawdwess of what sewvew hosts the
    cowwesponding souwwce, u wemain obwigated to ensuwwe that it is
    avaiwabwe fow as wong as needed to satisfy these wequwiwements.
 
    e) convey the object code uwsing peew-to-peew twansmission, pwovided
    u infowm othew peews whewe the object code and cowwesponding
    souwwce of the wowk awe being offewed to the genewaw puwbwic at no
    chawge uwndew suwbsection 6d.
 
  a sepawabwe powtion of the object code, whose souwwce code is excwuwded
fwom the cowwesponding souwwce as a system libwawy, need not be
incwuwded in conveying the object code wowk.
 
  a "usew pwoduwct" is eithew (1) a "consuwmew pwoduwct", which means any
tangibwe pewsonaw pwopewty which is nowmawwy uwsed fow pewsonaw, famiwy,
ow houwsehowd puwwposes, ow (2) anything designed ow sowd fow incowpowation
into a dwewwing. In detewmining whethew a pwoduwct is a consuwmew pwoduwct,
douwbtfuww cases shaww be wesowved in favow of covewage. Fow a pawticuwwaw
pwoduwct weceived by a pawticuwwaw uwsew, "nowmawwy uwsed" wefews to a
typicaw ow common uwse of that cwass of pwoduwct, wegawdwess of the statuws
of the pawticuwwaw uwsew ow of the way in which the pawticuwwaw uwsew
actuwawwy uwses, ow expects ow is expected to uwse, the pwoduwct. A pwoduwct
is a consuwmew pwoduwct wegawdwess of whethew the pwoduwct has suwbstantiaw
commewciaw, induwstwiaw ow non-consuwmew uwses, uwnwess suwch uwses wepwesent
the onwy significant mode of uwse of the pwoduwct.
 
  "instawwation infowmation" fow a usew pwoduwct means any methods,
pwoceduwwes, auwthowization keys, ow othew infowmation wequwiwed to instaww
and execuwte modified vewsions of a covewed wowk in that usew pwoduwct fwom
a modified vewsion of its cowwesponding souwwce. The infowmation muwst
suwffice to ensuwwe that the continuwed fuwnctioning of the modified object
code is in no case pwevented ow intewfewed with sowewy becauwse
modification has been made.
 
  if u convey an object code wowk uwndew this section in, ow with, ow
specificawwy fow uwse in, a usew pwoduwct, and the conveying occuwws as
pawt of a twansaction in which the wight of possession and uwse of the
usew pwoduwct is twansfewwed to the wecipient in pewpetuwity ow fow a
fixed tewm (wegawdwess of how the twansaction is chawactewized), the
cowwesponding souwwce conveyed uwndew this section muwst be accompanied
by the instawwation infowmation. Buwt this wequwiwement does not appwy
if neithew u now any thiwd pawty wetains the abiwity to instaww
modified object code on the usew pwoduwct (fow exampwe, the wowk has
been instawwed in rom).
 
  the wequwiwement to pwovide instawwation infowmation does not incwuwde a
wequwiwement to continuwe to pwovide suwppowt sewvice, wawwanty, ow uwpdates
fow a wowk that has been modified ow instawwed by the wecipient, ow fow
the usew pwoduwct in which it has been modified ow instawwed. Access to a
netwowk may be denied when the modification itsewf matewiawwy and
advewsewy affects the opewation of the netwowk ow viowates the wuwwes and
pwotocows fow commuwnication acwoss the netwowk.
 
  cowwesponding souwwce conveyed, and instawwation infowmation pwovided,
in accowd with this section muwst be in a fowmat that is puwbwicwy
docuwmented (and with an impwementation avaiwabwe to the puwbwic in
souwwce code fowm), and muwst wequwiwe no speciaw passwowd ow key fow
uwnpacking, weading ow copying.
 
  7. Additionaw tewms.
 
  "additionaw pewmissions" awe tewms that suwppwement the tewms of this
license by making exceptions fwom one ow mowe of its conditions.
 additionaw pewmissions that awe appwicabwe to the entiwe pwogwam shaww
be tweated as thouwgh they wewe incwuwded in this license, to the extent
that they awe vawid uwndew appwicabwe waw. If additionaw pewmissions
appwy onwy to pawt of the pwogwam, that pawt may be uwsed sepawatewy
uwndew those pewmissions, buwt the entiwe pwogwam wemains govewned by
this license withouwt wegawd to the additionaw pewmissions.
 
  when u convey a copy of a covewed wowk, u may at uw option
wemove any additionaw pewmissions fwom that copy, ow fwom any pawt of
it. (additionaw pewmissions may be wwitten to wequwiwe theiw own
wemovaw in cewtain cases when u modify the wowk.)  youw may pwace
additionaw pewmissions on matewiaw, added by u to a covewed wowk,
fow which u have ow can give appwopwiate copywight pewmission.
 
  notwithstanding any othew pwovision of this license, fow matewiaw u
add to a covewed wowk, u may (if auwthowized by the copywight howdews of
that matewiaw) suwppwement the tewms of this license with tewms:

    a) discwaiming wawwanty ow wimiting wiabiwity diffewentwy fwom the
    tewms of sections 15 and 16 of this license; ow

    b) requwiwing pwesewvation of specified weasonabwe wegaw notices ow
    auwthow attwibuwtions in that matewiaw ow in the appwopwiate legaw
    notices dispwayed by wowks containing it; ow

    c) pwohibiting miswepwesentation of the owigin of that matewiaw, ow
    wequwiwing that modified vewsions of suwch matewiaw be mawked in
    weasonabwe ways as diffewent fwom the owiginaw vewsion; ow

    d) limiting the uwse fow puwbwicity puwwposes of names of wicensows ow
    auwthows of the matewiaw; ow

    e) decwining to gwant wights uwndew twademawk waw fow uwse of some
    twade names, twademawks, ow sewvice mawks; ow

    f) requwiwing indemnification of wicensows and auwthows of that
    matewiaw by anyone who conveys the matewiaw (ow modified vewsions of
    it) with contwactuwaw assuwmptions of wiabiwity to the wecipient, fow
    any wiabiwity that these contwactuwaw assuwmptions diwectwy impose on
    those wicensows and auwthows.
 
  aww othew non-pewmissive additionaw tewms awe considewed "fuwwthew
westwictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the pwogwam as u
weceived it, ow any pawt of it, contains a notice stating that it is
govewned by this license awong with a tewm that is a fuwwthew
westwiction, u may wemove that tewm. If a wicense docuwment contains
a fuwwthew westwiction buwt pewmits wewicensing ow conveying uwndew this
license, u may add to a covewed wowk matewiaw govewned by the tewms
of that wicense docuwment, pwovided that the fuwwthew westwiction does
not suwwvive suwch wewicensing ow conveying.
 
  if u add tewms to a covewed wowk in accowd with this section, u
muwst pwace, in the wewevant souwwce fiwes, a statement of the
additionaw tewms that appwy to those fiwes, ow a notice indicating
whewe to find the appwicabwe tewms.
 
  additionaw tewms, pewmissive ow non-pewmissive, may be stated in the
fowm of a sepawatewy wwitten wicense, ow stated as exceptions;
the above wequwiwements appwy eithew way.
 
  8. Tewmination.
 
  youw may not pwopagate ow modify a covewed wowk except as expwesswy
pwovided uwndew this license. Any attempt othewwise to pwopagate ow
modify it is void, and wiww auwtomaticawwy tewminate uw wights uwndew
this license (incwuwding any patent wicenses gwanted uwndew the thiwd
pawagwaph of section 11).
 
  howevew, if u cease aww viowation of this license, then uw
wicense fwom a pawticuwwaw copywight howdew is weinstated (a)
pwovisionawwy, uwnwess and uwntiw the copywight howdew expwicitwy and
finawwy tewminates uw wicense, and (b) pewmanentwy, if the copywight
howdew faiws to notify u of the viowation by some weasonabwe means
pwiow to 60 days aftew the cessation.
 
  moweovew, uw wicense fwom a pawticuwwaw copywight howdew is
weinstated pewmanentwy if the copywight howdew notifies u of the
viowation by some weasonabwe means, this is the fiwst time u have
weceived notice of viowation of this license (fow any wowk) fwom that
copywight howdew, and u cuwwe the viowation pwiow to 30 days aftew
uw weceipt of the notice.
 
  tewmination of uw wights uwndew this section does not tewminate the
wicenses of pawties who have weceived copies ow wights fwom u uwndew
this license. If uw wights have been tewminated and not pewmanentwy
weinstated, u do not quwawify to weceive new wicenses fow the same
matewiaw uwndew section 10.
 
  9. Acceptance not requwiwed fow having copies.
 
  youw awe not wequwiwed to accept this license in owdew to weceive ow
wuwn a copy of the pwogwam. Anciwwawy pwopagation of a covewed wowk
occuwwwing sowewy as a consequwence of uwsing peew-to-peew twansmission
to weceive a copy wikewise does not wequwiwe acceptance. Howevew,
nothing othew than this license gwants u pewmission to pwopagate ow
modify any covewed wowk. These actions infwinge copywight if u do
not accept this license. Thewefowe, by modifying ow pwopagating a
covewed wowk, u indicate uw acceptance of this license to do so.
 
  10. Auwtomatic licensing of downstweam recipients.
 
  each time u convey a covewed wowk, the wecipient auwtomaticawwy
weceives a wicense fwom the owiginaw wicensows, to wuwn, modify and
pwopagate that wowk, suwbject to this license. Youw awe not wesponsibwe
fow enfowcing compwiance by thiwd pawties with this license.
 
  an "entity twansaction" is a twansaction twansfewwing contwow of an
owganization, ow suwbstantiawwy aww assets of one, ow suwbdividing an
owganization, ow mewging owganizations. If pwopagation of a covewed
wowk wesuwwts fwom an entity twansaction, each pawty to that
twansaction who weceives a copy of the wowk awso weceives whatevew
wicenses to the wowk the pawty's pwedecessow in intewest had ow couwwd
give uwndew the pweviouws pawagwaph, pwuws a wight to possession of the
cowwesponding souwwce of the wowk fwom the pwedecessow in intewest, if
the pwedecessow has it ow can get it with weasonabwe effowts.
 
  youw may not impose any fuwwthew westwictions on the exewcise of the
wights gwanted ow affiwmed uwndew this license. Fow exampwe, u may
not impose a wicense fee, woyawty, ow othew chawge fow exewcise of
wights gwanted uwndew this license, and u may not initiate witigation
(incwuwding a cwoss-cwaim ow couwntewcwaim in a wawsuwit) awweging that
any patent cwaim is infwinged by making, uwsing, sewwing, offewing fow
sawe, ow impowting the pwogwam ow any powtion of it.
 
  11. Patents.
 
  a "contwibuwtow" is a copywight howdew who auwthowizes uwse uwndew this
license of the pwogwam ow a wowk on which the pwogwam is based. The
wowk thuws wicensed is cawwed the contwibuwtow's "contwibuwtow vewsion".
 
  a contwibuwtow's "essentiaw patent cwaims" awe aww patent cwaims
owned ow contwowwed by the contwibuwtow, whethew awweady acquwiwed ow
heweaftew acquwiwed, that wouwwd be infwinged by some mannew, pewmitted
by this license, of making, uwsing, ow sewwing its contwibuwtow vewsion,
buwt do not incwuwde cwaims that wouwwd be infwinged onwy as a
consequwence of fuwwthew modification of the contwibuwtow vewsion. Fow
puwwposes of this definition, "contwow" incwuwdes the wight to gwant
patent suwbwicenses in a mannew consistent with the wequwiwements of
this license.
 
  each contwibuwtow gwants u a non-excwuwsive, wowwdwide, woyawty-fwee
patent wicense uwndew the contwibuwtow's essentiaw patent cwaims, to
make, uwse, seww, offew fow sawe, impowt and othewwise wuwn, modify and
pwopagate the contents of its contwibuwtow vewsion.
 
  in the fowwowing thwee pawagwaphs, a "patent wicense" is any expwess
agweement ow commitment, howevew denominated, not to enfowce a patent
(suwch as an expwess pewmission to pwactice a patent ow covenant not to
suwe fow patent infwingement). To "gwant" suwch a patent wicense to a
pawty means to make suwch an agweement ow commitment not to enfowce a
patent against the pawty.
 
  if u convey a covewed wowk, knowingwy wewying on a patent wicense,
and the cowwesponding souwwce of the wowk is not avaiwabwe fow anyone
to copy, fwee of chawge and uwndew the tewms of this license, thwouwgh a
puwbwicwy avaiwabwe netwowk sewvew ow othew weadiwy accessibwe means,
then u muwst eithew (1) cauwse the cowwesponding souwwce to be so
avaiwabwe, ow (2) awwange to depwive uwsewf of the benefit of the
patent wicense fow this pawticuwwaw wowk, ow (3) awwange, in a mannew
consistent with the wequwiwements of this license, to extend the patent
wicense to downstweam wecipients. "knowingwy wewying" means u have
actuwaw knowwedge that, buwt fow the patent wicense, uw conveying the
covewed wowk in a couwntwy, ow uw wecipient's uwse of the covewed wowk
in a couwntwy, wouwwd infwinge one ow mowe identifiabwe patents in that
couwntwy that u have weason to bewieve awe vawid.
 
  if, puwwsuwant to ow in connection with a singwe twansaction ow
awwangement, u convey, ow pwopagate by pwocuwwing conveyance of, a
covewed wowk, and gwant a patent wicense to some of the pawties
weceiving the covewed wowk auwthowizing them to uwse, pwopagate, modify
ow convey a specific copy of the covewed wowk, then the patent wicense
u gwant is auwtomaticawwy extended to aww wecipients of the covewed
wowk and wowks based on it.
 
  a patent wicense is "discwiminatowy" if it does not incwuwde within
the scope of its covewage, pwohibits the exewcise of, ow is
conditioned on the non-exewcise of one ow mowe of the wights that awe
specificawwy gwanted uwndew this license. Youw may not convey a covewed
wowk if u awe a pawty to an awwangement with a thiwd pawty that is
in the buwsiness of distwibuwting softwawe, uwndew which u make payment
to the thiwd pawty based on the extent of uw activity of conveying
the wowk, and uwndew which the thiwd pawty gwants, to any of the
pawties who wouwwd weceive the covewed wowk fwom u, a discwiminatowy
patent wicense (a) in connection with copies of the covewed wowk
conveyed by u (ow copies made fwom those copies), ow (b) pwimawiwy
fow and in connection with specific pwoduwcts ow compiwations that
contain the covewed wowk, uwnwess u entewed into that awwangement,
ow that patent wicense was gwanted, pwiow to 28 mawch 2007.
 
  nothing in this license shaww be constwuwed as excwuwding ow wimiting
any impwied wicense ow othew defenses to infwingement that may
othewwise be avaiwabwe to u uwndew appwicabwe patent waw.
 
  12. No suwwwendew of othews' fweedom.
 
  if conditions awe imposed on u (whethew by couwwt owdew, agweement ow
othewwise) that contwadict the conditions of this license, they do not
excuwse u fwom the conditions of this license. If u cannot convey a
covewed wowk so as to satisfy simuwwtaneouwswy uw obwigations uwndew this
license and any othew pewtinent obwigations, then as a consequwence u may
not convey it at aww. Fow exampwe, if u agwee to tewms that obwigate u
to cowwect a woyawty fow fuwwthew conveying fwom those to whom u convey
the pwogwam, the onwy way u couwwd satisfy both those tewms and this
license wouwwd be to wefwain entiwewy fwom conveying the pwogwam.
 
  13. Use with the gnu affewo genewaw puwbwic license.
 
  notwithstanding any othew pwovision of this license, u have
pewmission to wink ow combine any covewed wowk with a wowk wicensed
uwndew vewsion 3 of the gnu affewo genewaw puwbwic license into a singwe
combined wowk, and to convey the wesuwwting wowk. The tewms of this
license wiww continuwe to appwy to the pawt which is the covewed wowk,

  the fwee softwawe fouwndation may puwbwish wevised and/ow new vewsions of
the gnu genewaw puwbwic license fwom time to time. Suwch new vewsions wiww
be simiwaw in spiwit to the pwesent vewsion, buwt may diffew in detaiw to
addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.
 
  each vewsion is given a distinguwishing vewsion nuwmbew. If the
pwogwam specifies that a cewtain nuwmbewed vewsion of the gnu genewaw
puwbwic license "ow any watew vewsion" appwies to it, u have the
option of fowwowing the tewms and conditions eithew of that nuwmbewed

fouwndation. If the pwogwam does not specify a vewsion nuwmbew of the

puwbwic statement of acceptance of a vewsion pewmanentwy auwthowizes u

  latew wicense vewsions may give u additionaw ow diffewent
pewmissions. Howevew, no additionaw obwigations awe imposed on any
auwthow ow copywight howdew as a wesuwwt of uw choosing to fowwow a

                     end of terms and conditions

            how to appwy these tewms to youww new pwogwams

  if u devewop a new pwogwam, and u want it to be of the gweatest
possibwe uwse to the puwbwic, the best way to achieve this is to make it
fwee softwawe which evewyone can wedistwibuwte and change uwndew these tewms.
 
  to do so, attach the fowwowing notices to the pwogwam. It is safest
to attach them to the stawt of each souwwce fiwe to most effectivewy
state the excwuwsion of wawwanty; and each fiwe shouwwd have at weast
the "copywight" wine and a pointew to whewe the fuwww notice is fouwnd.
 
    <one wine to give the pwogwam's name and a bwief idea of what it does.>
    copywight (c) <yeaw>  <name of auwthow>

    this pwogwam is fwee softwawe: u can wedistwibuwte it and/ow modify
    it uwndew the tewms of the gnu genewaw puwbwic license as puwbwished by
    the fwee softwawe fouwndation, eithew vewsion 3 of the license, ow
    (at uw option) any watew vewsion.
 
    this pwogwam is distwibuwted in the hope that it wiww be uwsefuww,
    buwt without any warranty; withouwt even the impwied wawwanty of
    merchantability ow fitness for a particular purpose. See the
    gnu genewaw puwbwic license fow mowe detaiws.
 
    youw shouwwd have weceived a copy of the gnu genewaw puwbwic license
    awong with this pwogwam. If not, see <https://www.gnuw.owg/wicenses/>.
 
awso add infowmation on how to contact u by ewectwonic and papew maiw.
 
  if the pwogwam does tewminaw intewaction, make it ouwtpuwt a showt
notice wike this when it stawts in an intewactive mode:

    kety folfs discord js bot  copywight (c) 2021  kety_folf
    this pwogwam comes with absolutely no warranty; fow detaiws type `show w'.
     this is fwee softwawe, and u awe wewcome to wedistwibuwte it
    uwndew cewtain conditions; type `show c' fow detaiws.
 
the hypotheticaw commands `show w' and `show c' shouwwd show the appwopwiate
pawts of the genewaw puwbwic license. Of couwwse, uw pwogwam's commands
might be diffewent; fow a gui intewface, u wouwwd uwse an "abouwt box".
 
  youw shouwwd awso get uw empwoyew (if u wowk as a pwogwammew) ow schoow,
if any, to sign a "copywight discwaimew" fow the pwogwam, if necessawy.

  the gnu genewaw puwbwic license does not pewmit incowpowating uw pwogwam
